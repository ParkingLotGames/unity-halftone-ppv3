# Unity Halftone Shader Effect

This small Unity project uses a custom shader to render the camera view as a halftone image using the CGA4 palette (magenta/cyan/black and white).

The script loads the shader and uses it OnRender. 

This makes it possible to apply the effect as an image post processing and makes the halftone work on the screen coordinates so it's like applying a real halftone to the frame.
